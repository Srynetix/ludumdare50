**:rocket: [Play it here!](https://srynetix.github.io/time-lab/)**

The concept is _once again_ simple: you are trapped in a laboratory, filled with puzzles, where time is your enemy.  
Instructions are included in the game, and _once again_, it is **quite challenging**.

There is a secret end, think fast :wink:!

**Features**:
- A *level collection system* for an open-ended range of levels!
- Original level collection for the Ludum Dare 50 (12 levels),
- A *level selector* to browse collections,
- An *in-game level editor* to create your own challenges, that you can export/import and share to the world (with binary files or Base64!)

**Software used**:
- Godot Engine 3.4.4 with my [`sxgd`](https://github.com/Srynetix/sxgd) addon,
- sfxia,
- aseprite 1.3-beta14,
- FL Studio

**Assets used**:
- Jost font (https://github.com/indestructible-type/Jost)

_Good luck, and have fun!_
