**:rocket: [Play it here!](https://srynetix.github.io/ludumdare50/Time%20Lab)**

Welcome on my 4th **Ludum Dare** Compo entry!

The concept is _once again_ simple: you are trapped in a laboratory, filled with puzzles, where time is your enemy.  
Instructions are included in the game, and _once again_, it is **quite challenging**.

There is a secret end, think fast :wink:!

**Software used**:
- Godot Engine 3.4.4 (mono edition) with a few addons of mine (_fx_, _nodeext_, _mathext_),
- sfxia,
- aseprite 1.3-beta14,
- FL Studio

**Assets used**:
- Jost font (https://github.com/indestructible-type/Jost)

_Good luck, and have fun!_
